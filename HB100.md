# HB100 proximity sensor
- I set SwitchMode to 13
- SwitchMode 13
Set switch to "push to on" mode (1 = ON, 0 = nothing)

Tasmota will send an ON command when the button pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Switch off using PulseTime.

I wrote the rule - to get the rely on for both states

Rule1 on Switch1#state=1 do Power1 ON endon on Switch1#state=0 do Power1 ON endon
Rule1 1
